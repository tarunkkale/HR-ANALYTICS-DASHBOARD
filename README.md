⭐ 6. Key Drivers of Employee Attrition
(Exact Factors From Dashboard Visuals)

This section highlights the main factors causing attrition, based entirely on your plots.

🎓 1. Education

Attrition by Education (Donut Chart)

Life Sciences → Highest attrition (37.55%)

Human Resources → Lowest attrition (2.95%)

HR education attrition (internal): 58.33%

Marketing, Life Sciences, Medical, Technical, and Others show variation based on role expectations and salary ranges.

👤 2. Age

Attrition by Age (Bar Chart)

26–35 age group → Highest turnover (116 employees)

Early-career professionals show maximum movement

HR department loses majority talent in this group

🧪 3. Job Role

Top Attrition Job Roles (Horizontal Bar)

Laboratory Technicians → Highest attrition

Sales Executive → High exits

Sales Representative → Notable exits

Manager → Low attrition

Laboratory roles also show low job satisfaction, making them more likely to leave.

💰 4. Salary Per Month

Salary Slabs (Bar Chart)

Up to 5K → Highest attrition (163 employees)

Salary is the No.1 attrition driver across all departments

Lower slabs under 5K show maximum exits

A clear pattern shows pay is a major cause of turnover.

⏳ 5. Years at Company (Tenure)

Attrition by Tenure (Area Chart)

Maximum attrition in 0–1 year

Overall 0–5 years → Most vulnerable

HR, R&D, and Sales follow the same early-tenure loss pattern

Peak at Year 2 (17 employees leaving)

⭐ 6. Satisfaction Levels

Low job satisfaction is strongly correlated with attrition

Lab Technicians → Lowest satisfaction

Sales Executives & HR junior staff → Also dissatisfied

This supports the attrition patterns seen in job role and department analysis.

⭐ 7. Additional Insights (From Your Slides)
Age + Role + Salary Combination

The 26–35 age group coupled with low salary is highly prone to leaving.

Roles with lower satisfaction plus low pay (Lab Technicians, Sales Executives) show the highest turnover.

Education Patterns

Life Sciences and Marketing education segments show higher exits based on job expectations and pay.

Department Patterns

HR, R&D, and Sales share similar attrition behavior in the early tenure range.
